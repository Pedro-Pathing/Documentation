# Pick your Localizer

### These are the current localizers supported:
- Drive Encoder Localizer 
- Two-Wheel Localizer
- Three-Wheel Localizer
- Three-Wheel + IMU Localizer
- OTOS Localizer
- Pinpoint Localizer

The localizers use a pose exponential method of localization, a way of turning movements from the robot's coordinate frame to the global coordinate frame. 

However, the OTOS localizer uses its own onboard system for calculating localization, which we do not know about.
